As part of application development, developers create a role template during design time, which consists of scopes and attributes. Once the application is deployed, an administrator can create a role from this role template, which can then be assigned to a role collection.

For more information about the relevant security aspects and how to set those up, see [Adding Authentication and Authorization](https://help.sap.com/viewer/ae8e8427ecdf407790d96dad93b5f723/Cloud/en-US/419ae2ef1ddd49dca9eb65af2d67c6ec.html "Developers create authorization information for business users in their environment and deploy this information in an application.
