As part of application development, developers create a role template during design time, which consists of scopes and attributes. Once the application is deployed, an administrator can create a role from this role template, which can then be assigned to a role collection.

For more information about the relevant security aspects and how to set those up, see [Adding Authentication and Authorization](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/419ae2ef1ddd49dca9eb65af2d67c6ec.html "Developers create authorization information for business users in their environment and deploy this information in an application.
