# Go Live and Monitor

Once you've deployed, transported, tested, and integrated your application, you can go live.

After you've released an application, you have to ensure that it's provided with the right performance and availability by monitoring its various parts â€“ such as platform services, application parts, and databases. SAP BTP offers various native tools for monitoring and operating your application, optionally complemented by third-party offerings, in case you need deep monitoring of cloud-native applications.

For hybrid scenarios across the SAP portfolio, or if you already have an operations process in place, you can also integrate operation aspects of SAP BTP into strategic operation platforms \(such as SAP Solution Manager, SAP Focused Run of SAP Solution Manager, and SAP Cloud ALM\).

## Monitoring Applications and Services

There are various options you can use to monitor applications and services on SAP BTP, provided natively by the platform itself. Which of them you might use depends on the SAP BTP environments you work in.



<a name="loio318c3653da0f42c88bd7a1c38273f79e__section_jsb_jz3_p2b"/>

## Monitoring Applications in the Cloud Foundry Environment

In the Cloud Foundry environment, you can use the [SAP Application Logging service for SAP BTP](https://help.sap.com/viewer/ee8e8a203e024bbb8c8c2d03fce527dc/Cloud/en-US/68454d44ad41458788959485a24305e2.html) to access logs from your applications. You can also run the Cloud Foundry CLI command `cf logs` to show the recent logs for an application. For more information, see the Cloud Foundry documentation at [https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/streaming-logs.html](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/streaming-logs.html).

> ### Note:  
> Container metrics in syslog drains are not currently logged by SAP BTP, but you can use the SAP Application Logging service to access container metrics of your applications.

You can also configure health checks that continually monitor the status of a running application. For more information, see [https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/healthchecks.html](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/healthchecks.html).

## Going Live

Once you've tested your application successfully and ensured that you are compliant with any applicable security guidelines and compliance regulations, you can go live with your application.

If you've set up a staged development environment, we recommend that your Cloud Administration Team defines specific timeframes during which the Cloud Development Team is allowed to go live with an application. You can forbid go-live activities during times that a stable landscape is particularly crucial \(for example, at the end of each quarter\), and allow deployments to your production subaccount only in case of emergencies.

Consider embedding applications with internal end users in the SAP Fiori launchpad using SAP BTP Portal before you go live. This enables your internal target audience to access all applications in one central place and thus improves the app's usability. For more information, see [SAP Cloud Portal Service](https://https://help.sap.com/viewer/ad4b9f0b14b0458cad9bd27bf435637d/Cloud/en-US/5798687972fd4c2bace31c65b47f5587.html).



<a name="loiob21821e37ea14f69af731bf5811af338__section_b2p_p5d_fpb"/>

## Manage Authentication and Authorization

Ensure that the business users of your application are being provided by using SAP ID service or configuring the trust relationship to an external identity provider. They should also get the right authorization by using application-based authorization artifacts provided by the developers. This allows the administrators to create roles, build role collections, and assign these collections to business users and user groups.

For more information, see [Security Administration: Managing Authentication and Authorization](https://help.sap.com/viewer/ae8e8427ecdf407790d96dad93b5f723/Cloud/en-US/1ff47b2d980e43a6b2ce294352333708.html "This section describes the tasks of administrators in the Cloud Foundry environment of SAP BTP. Administrators ensure user authentication and assign authorization information to users and user groups.") :arrow_upper_right: .



<a name="loiob21821e37ea14f69af731bf5811af338__section_lcm_pll_zgb"/>

## Web Acceleration

If your application's end users are widely spread across different countries or even continents, you can improve your application's load performance by using a Content Delivery Network \(CDN\). For example, you can use common CDN providers such as Akami or Cloudflare.

If you include SAPâ€™s SAPUI5 library directly from *\*.hana.ondemand.com*, the SAPUI5 resources are automatically delivered via a CDN. See [Variant for Bootstrapping from Content Delivery Network](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/topic/2d3eb2f322ea4a82983c1c62a33ec4ae).

Consider the following when using a CDN:

-   Secure transport: Make sure any access via HTTP will get redirected to a HTTPS connection before loading any content.

-   Block access based on location: If blocking access from a certain country is required, the clientâ€™s location data can be used. Keep in mind that this does not guarantee a full blocking, since the clientâ€™s location data can be changed, or the client could access from another country via a virtual private network \(VPN\).

-   Content compression: You can compress your content with gzip before it gets delivered to the client. This improves the performance, especially for clients with a slow connection.

-   Content caching: In addition to client caching, you can make the CDN provider cache your serverâ€™s content, so that following requests of the same resources by other clients will be delivered faster. While this can additionally improve the performance, you need to keep in mind the following:

    -   Make sure that you only cache static content. We recommend that you exclude certain files \(for example, for UI5 apps, exclude the neo-app.json file\) or paths \(for example, a route to OData services\), to make sure dynamic content is never cached.

    -   You should configure your CDN provider so that it respects the `Cache-Control` and `Expires` header of your server.

    -   You should not cache any dynamic header, such as the `X-CSRF-Token` header, that is used against cross-site request forgery \(CSRF\).


-   See [SAP Note 2943781](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/SAP Note 2943781) for information about using CDN for on-premise systems.
