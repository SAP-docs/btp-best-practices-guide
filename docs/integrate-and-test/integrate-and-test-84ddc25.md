## Performing Integration Tests

In contrast to unit tests that are performed locally on your development subaccount without any external dependencies in the develop and build phase, integration tests target the interplay of a complete system, spanning several single components and units potentially spread throughout a hybrid landscape. Integration tests verify that all building blocks work together, meet specified requirements, and fulfill the targeted business case. They should therefore then be executed on your test infrastructure or in your test subaccount after the integration into an existing landscape has taken place. This ensures that the interplay with backend functionalities is verified. In a CI/CD setup, note that such integration tests are part of the pipeline.

## Integration Tests for SAPUI5

One Page Acceptance Tests \(OPA5\) is an API for SAPUI5 controls. It hides asynchronicity and eases access to SAPUI5 elements. This makes OPA especially helpful for testing user interactions, integration with SAPUI5, navigation, and data binding. See [Integration Testing with One Page Acceptance Tests \(OPA5\)](https://help.sap.com/doc/saphelp_uiaddon20/2.05/en-US/7c/dee404cac441888539ed7bfe076e57/frameset.htm).

## Integrating Your Application

SAP BTP offers various options for integrating your cloud application with other cloud and on-premise solutions.

## Cloud Connector

If you want an application running on SAP BTP to access data from your on-premise back-end system, we recommend that you use the Cloud Connector. It's an on-premise piece of software that you'll need to install in your on-premise landscape, within the firewall. Once it's configured and paired with your SAP BTP subaccount, a secure tunnel is established between SAP BTP \(and all the services and applications that run on it\) and the Cloud Connector. Communication between SAP BTP and the back-end system is routed via the Cloud Connector through a secure SSL tunnel.

We recommend that you use the Cloud Connector if your use case requires any of the following:

-   Point-to-point connectivity and programmatic integration
-   Connectivity with cloud applications from on-premise systems, without mediation, such as for mapping, routing, or security
-   Data replication from on-premise databases or Business Intelligence tools to SAP HANA databases running in the cloud
-   On-premise system integration using SAP Cloud Integration

For more information, see [Cloud Connector](https://help.sap.com/viewer/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/Cloud/en-US/e6c7616abb5710148cfcf3e75d96d596.html "Learn more about the Cloud Connector: features, scenarios and setup.") :arrow_upper_right:.

## SAP Cloud Integration

SAP Cloud Integration \(Cloud Integration\) supports end-to-end process integration across cloud and on-premise applications \(cloud to cloud and cloud to on-premise integration\). It provides the following features:

-   Core runtime for processing, transforming, and routing of messages to be exchanged between your systems

-   Out-of-the-box connectivity support \(IDoc, SFTP, SOAP/HTTPS, SAP SuccessFactors, OData, HTTPS\)
-   Security features such as content encryption and certificate-based communication

Cloud Integration offers full flexibility for the manner in which messages are exchanged between your systems. We recommend that you use the Cloud Connector if you require any of the following \(or if you don't require on-premise-based middleware, such as SAP Process Orchestration\):

-   Compliance scenarios, such as e-invoicing and payroll
-   Graphical model of integration flow
-   More than a few systems to be integrated, and you'd like to managed integrations centrally, rather than having to manually code applications when connections change
-   Individual messages to be processed during integration
-   Integration with third-party solutions

For more information, see [SAP Cloud Integration](https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/CLOUD_INTEGRATION/Cloud/en-US).

## Cloud Integration Automation Service

If you're planning on integrating your SAP BTP application into a hybrid landscape, you can also leverage the Cloud Integration Automation Service that is offered for selected integration scenarios. This service provides a guided workflow that uses customer-specific system information, reusable configuration settings between tasks, and automated execution capabilities, thereby reducing the manual work for your scenario integration. For more information, see [Cloud Integration Automation Service](https://help.sap.com/viewer/p/Cloud%20Integration%20Automation%20Service).
