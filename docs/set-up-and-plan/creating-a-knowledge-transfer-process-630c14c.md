# Creating a Knowledge Transfer Process

Carefully plan for sufficient enablement of all stakeholders, and ensure that the knowledge gained throughout your application lifecycle is shared with others.

Before you start your development project, we recommend that you do the following:

-   Ensure that the Platform Engineering Team, which should consist of skilled and experienced technology experts, documents and shares their knowledge with existing and new colleagues.
-   Set up training and enablement sessions to get everyone on board.
-   Create and promote a dedicated communication channel, such as SAP Jam Collaboration, to share lessons learned or provide other developers with guidance and recommendations. For more information, see [SAP Jam Collaboration](https://www.sap.com/products/enterprise-social-collaboration.html).
