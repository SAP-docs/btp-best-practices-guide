# Complying with Data Protection and Privacy Requirements

All companies must respect data protection and privacy rights of individuals. Data protection and privacy most likely influences the architecture and functionalities of your application and should be considered as early as possible in the development process.

It's important you understand that simply using SAP software, such as SAP BTP, does not make your applications compliant. However, SAP software can help you achieve compliance. You should consult legal experts to determine the requirements for your applications and specific use cases.

> ### Note:  
> SAP does not provide legal advice in any form. SAP software supports data protection compliance by providing security features and data protection-relevant functions that can help to establish a compliant identity lifecycle management. In many cases, compliance with applicable data protection and privacy laws is not covered by a single product feature, and sometimes, not even within a product. For instance, users' wish to delete their personal data usually requires data deletion in several integrated systems.

Decisions related to data protection must be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the given system landscape and the applicable legal requirements.
