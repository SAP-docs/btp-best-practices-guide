# Role-Based Access Control \(RBAC\) in Kyma

Assigning permissions in Kyma is based on the Kubernetes role-based access control \(RBAC\). It’s recommended that you start with separating the developers and operators of a cluster. Later, you can refine the role concept as required.

## Recommended Role Setup

The goal of the recommended role setup is to implement Kubernetes RBAC best practices, which is a method of regulating access to computer or network resources based on the roles of individual users within your organization.

The role setup separates the operators from the development teams, and day-to-day user accounts from administrative accounts. It enables DevOps while ensuring security on production clusters.

In production clusters and development and test clusters alike, each service, project, or development team should have its own namespace.

Typically, it‘s useful that developers have read access to dedicated resources on cluster level or in other namespaces, such as “Istio” or “Application Connector”. Use the ClusterRole `common-resource-viewer` for this. Additional modules can bring additional resources. For more information, see [Kyma Modules](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/0dda141a58d54f29a860a4b3164bf4a9.html "With Kyma's modular approach, you can install just the modules you need, instead of a predefined set of components.") :arrow_upper_right:.

-   The suggested setup uses the [Kubernetes objects](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#api-overview) “ClusterRole”, “RoleBinding”, and “ClusterRoleBinding”. For examples of the required Kubernetes objects, see the suggested manifest templates.

-   In RoleBindings and ClusterRolebindings, use groups instead of users. For more information about group management in SAP Cloud Identity Services, see [Groups](https://help.sap.com/docs/IDENTITY_AUTHENTICATION/aa08922a434a456ba44982c9f4f4d790/ddd067c899f94e2f9006cc4dd417be80.html?locale=en-US).

-   To reduce the number of accounts directly assigned to powerful roles in the cluster, use Kubernetes impersonation.




### Impersonation in Kubernetes

With Kubernetes [User Impersonation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#user-impersonation), you can enable a least-privilege type of access to the Kubernetes cluster. With this feature, a subject \(that is, users, groups, or service accounts\) can acquire another Kubernetes user or group identity. These acquired identities are called “virtual users” or “vUser” because they don't need to exist.

Just create a ClusterRoleBinding that contains a virtual user \(`vUserName`\) and the administrative ClusterRole. For example, the operator or developer is allowed to impersonate the virtual user to perform administrative tasks.

## Role Setup for Operators

By default, operators only have view access in the clusters.

By impersonating a virtual user \(`cluster-admin`\) bound to the ClusterRole `cluster-admin`, the operator can perform administrative tasks.

## Role Setup for Developers \(Dev and Test\)

In **Dev** and **Test** clusters, developers have full access to their namespaces. In the namespace, bind them to the ClusterRole `admin`.

## Role Setup for Developers \(Prod\)

In **Prod** clusters, developers only have view access to their namespace. In the namespace, bind them to the ClusterRole `cluster-viewer`.

By impersonating a virtual user \(`<app-admin>`\) bound to the ClusterRole `admin`, a developer can perform administrative tasks in their namespace.
