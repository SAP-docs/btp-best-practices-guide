# Setting Up Your Account Model

The hierarchical structure between global accounts, directories, and subaccounts lets you define an account model that accurately fits your business and development needs.

Once you've signed your commercial contract with SAP, you'll receive access information and credentials for your global account. Use this account to manage the resources and entitlements for your development projects; it's the realization of your commercial contract with SAP. You'll also receive a bill for all resources used in your global account. If you require multiple global accounts for compliance or other reasons, you'll need to sign a dedicated contract for each one.

> ### Note:  
> SAP is currently migrating all global accounts from cloud management tools feature set A to the renovated cloud management tools feature set B. We’re doing this migration as a phased rollout, which is why cloud management tools feature sets A and B currently coexist. One big change that came with feature set B is a renovated account model: With feature set B, you can use**directories** to group and manage subaccounts inside your global account. For more information, see [Cloud Management Tools - Feature Set Overview](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/caf4e4e23aef4666ad8f125af393dfb2.html). Please make sure to understand if your global account is already on feature set B.

Within a global account that is on feature set B, you can create a hierarchical structure of directories and subaccounts that is up to 7 levels deep. Directories can group subaccounts and/or directories. To actually develop and deploy applications, to use services, and to subscribe to business applications provided by SAP, you need to create subaccounts. Directories are optional, but highly recommended as they offer a way to organize your subaccounts and to manage entitlements or users for an entire group of subaccounts. This means you can distribute the resources that are assigned to your global account across directories, and from there to the subaccounts inside a directory. Directories and subaccounts let you structure a global account according to the requirements of your organization and projects with regards to users, authorizations, and quotas.
