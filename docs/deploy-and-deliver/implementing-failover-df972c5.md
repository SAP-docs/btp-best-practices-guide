# Implementing Failover

Implementing failover ensures your applications remain available even during disruptions.

To effectively plan and execute failover strategies, first understand the foundational resilience mechanisms SAP BTP provides. This includes how SAP ensures high availability through availability zones, platform-level backups, and disaster recovery plans. For details and best practices for developing resilient applications that leverage these capabilities, see [Resilience, High Availability, and Disaster Recovery](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/resilience-high-availability-and-disaster-recovery?version=Cloud&locale=en-US).

For mission-critical applications requiring protection against regional outages, consider a multi-region setup. This advanced approach enables seamless failover to a secondary SAP BTP region and transparent rerouting of client traffic. To learn more about creating and managing such architectures, including basic concepts, service support, and reference architectures for custom multi-region solutions, see the [SAP BTP Multi-Region Guide](https://help.sap.com/docs/BTP/2c674b8190ef4978ba40ba8283cf5adb/ee5321d48737490b8acc4ba0cbd6e7fc.html?version=Cloud&locale=en-US).
