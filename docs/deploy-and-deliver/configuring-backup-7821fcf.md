## Services with Automated Data Backups

Data stored in the following services is automatically backed up by SAP:

-   **SAP HANA Cloud**: SAP HANA Cloud instances are continually backed up to safeguard your database and ensure that it can be recovered. For more information, see [Backup and Recovery](https://help.sap.com/docs/HANA_CLOUD/9ae9104a46f74a6583ce5182e7fb20cb/89d71f01daca4ecaaa069d6a060167f5.html).

-   **PostgreSQL on SAP BTP, Hyperscaler Option**: SAP keeps backups of your PostgreSQL database instances for a retention period of 14 days. You can restore a database instance to any point in time within the backup retention period by creating a new database instance. For more information, see [Restore Database Instance to a Specified Time](https://help.sap.com/viewer/b3fe3621fa4a4ed28d7bbe3d6d88f036/Cloud/en-US/724c9112ed5a48c59c8e88f17290550d.html).

-   **SAP BTP, Kyma environment**: The Kyma environment relies on managed Kubernetes clusters for periodic backups of Kubernetes objects. For more information, see [Kyma Environment Backup](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/ab959cfbd07b46af97aecfd6577bfb10.html).


Data stored using these services and components is fully backed up on a regular basis. For services running in the SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment, the backed-up data is copied to additional availability zones within the same region. Each availability zone represents a physically separate location with its own power supply, network, and cooling. For more information, see [Regions](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/350356d1dc314d3199dca15bd2ab9b0e.html).

For services running in the SAP BTP, Neo environment, the backed-up data is copied to an availability zone in another region. For more information, see [Regions in the Neo Environment](https://help.sap.com/viewer/ea72206b834e4ace9cd834feed6c0e09/Cloud/en-US/21c30a4e491544fc927ecf3a5857c54e.html).

## Services Without Automated Data Backups

The following services don’t currently provide any backup and restore features:

-   **Redis on SAP BTP, hyperscaler option**: This service doesn’t support persistence.

-   **Object Store on SAP BTP**: There's no backup and restore feature provided by the Object Store service. However, there are additional features that could help in backup and restore in certain scenarios:
    -   [Object Versioning](https://help.sap.com/viewer/2ee77ef7ea4648f9ab2c54ee3aef0a29/Cloud/en-US/787fbe77f4eb46e0ae9a6222d57ba50e.html) allows you to recover from accidental deletion and modification of objects because the hyperscalers keep older versions in case the objects are modified or deleted.

    -   [Object Expiration Rules](https://help.sap.com/viewer/2ee77ef7ea4648f9ab2c54ee3aef0a29/Cloud/en-US/52e2c18af86c45e2b1495cd594602304.html) helps with the automatic deletion of older versions.

    -   The **prevent deletion** feature helps preventing your blob stores from accidental deletion. For more information, see:

## Service Configurations Managed by Customers

SAP doesn't manage backups of service configurations. However, you can back up your service-specific configuration yourself. This backup allows you to restore your configuration in case it’s deleted by accident.
