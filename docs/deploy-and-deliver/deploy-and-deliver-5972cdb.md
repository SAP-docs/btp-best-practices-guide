# Deploy and Deliver

After you've developed your application, you need to deploy it and deliver it to your TEST and PROD environments. Furthermore, consider implementing failover.

If you have only a simple application \(such as for a small proof of concept\) and don't have the need for governance and scalability, you can consider performing a manual **deployment**, to bring your application into the corresponding runtime in your landscape. For deploying an application manually, you can choose between several native options, depending on your environment and application.

In enterprise environments, a managed and automated **delivery** approach is recommended – because it is less error-prone and creates repeatable outcomes. Furthermore, you can apply governance and central control of the propagation of your changes towards your production environment. For delivery, you can choose between several options, depending on your requirements and your environment.

Also, don't forget to implement **failover**, for example, by deploying your application to two different datacenters in parallel.
