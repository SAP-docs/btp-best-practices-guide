## 1. Fulfill Prerequisites

1.  Get familiar with SAP Business Technology Platform and its role within the intelligent, sustainable enterprise, understand the basic platform concepts and your responsibilities throughout the implementation project. See:

    -   [SAP BTP Guidance Framework](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-btp-guidance-framework/guidance-framework/what-is-sap-btp-guidance-framework)

    -   [Learning Journey: Discover SAP Business Technology Platform](https://learning.sap.com/learning-journey/discover-sap-business-technology-platform)

    -   [Basic Platform Concepts](../basic-platform-concepts/basic-platform-concepts-38ecf59.md#loio38ecf59cdda64150a102cfaa62d5faab)

    -   [Shared Responsibility Model Between You and SAP](../shared-responsibility/shared-responsibility-model-between-you-and-sap-898509d.md)


2.  Check out the [SAP Discovery Center](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/) to get an overview on the available SAP BTP **services**, discover **missions** that guide you step-by-step, and explore **reference architectures**.

3.  Identify one or more initial development projects or a pilot project. For examples, see [Use Cases on SAP BTP](https://www.sap.com/products/business-technology-platform/use-cases.html).

4.  Get familiar with the [Free Tier model](https://help.sap.com/docs/BTP/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/524e1081d8dc4b0f9d055a6bec383ec3.html) and decide whether you'd like to use it for development and testing. Only community support is available for free tier service plans and they are not subject to SLAs, so it's not recommended to use them for production. To find out which services are free in your desired SAP BTP contract, see [Free Tier and Always Free Tags in the SAP Discovery Center](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/trial-accounts-and-free-tier?version=Cloud#free-tier-and-always-free-tags-in-the-sap-discovery-center).

5.  Decide which commercial model \(subscription- or consumption-based\) best suits your needs, and sign contracts for SAP BTP. See [Commercial Models](https://help.sap.com/docs/BTP/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/263d40009a5a4237a62e8f5c05ee641e.html), [SAP BTP Pricing](https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/pricing.html?), and [SAP Integration Suite](https://www.sap.com/products/integration-suite/pricing.html) pricing.

6.  Review the Service Level Agreement. See [SAP BTP Service Description Guide](https://www.sap.com/about/agreements/policies/cloud-platform.html) and [SAP Trust Center](https://www.sap.com/about/trust-center.html).

7.  Receive an onboarding e-mail with a link to the SAP BTP cockpit.

    > ### Note:  
    > If you've chosen an existing global account from within your company, contact the global account admin of this global account, as they'll receive the communication emails. In this case, we recommend having them add you as Global Account Administrator. See [Assign Users to Role Collections](https://help.sap.com/docs/BTP/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/c5766765bda74ad59fe656977c8fa4d6.html?locale=en-US&version=Cloud).

8.  Obtain a customer number \(needed for support tickets\). If you don't know your customer number, check with your system administrator.

9.  Build a Platform Engineering Team \(respectively, a Cloud Center of Excellence\) and a Cloud Development Team. See [Building Teams](../set-up-and-plan/building-teams-fdeddf2.md#loiofdeddf22a6964d86a199b9eb11c7075e).
