## Is This Guide for You?

This guide is the starting point for setting up application lifecycle management for your specific use case, business, and IT landscape. It contains recommendations and best practices that give you an overview of what you should consider when planning development projects on SAP BTP. It does not contain specific task descriptions, but does include links to step-by-step instructions when required.

If you're an **architect or a development project lead**, this guide helps you plan your organizational setup and your account and security model. It has an overview of processes, tools, and services that are available for developing and operating applications. Please note that SAP is currently renovating and adding core functionalities to SAP BTP and as part of this process, global accounts are migrated from the existing cloud management tools feature set A to the renovated cloud management tools feature set B. New global accounts will be on feature set B which brings a more flexible account model with so-called **directories** to group and manage subaccounts inside your global account. For more information, see [Cloud Management Tools - Feature Set Overview](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/caf4e4e23aef4666ad8f125af393dfb2.html). In this Best Practices guide, you will get recommendations for feature set A and B. They are marked as such, but please ensure that you know if you are on feature set B already.
