# Contributions to the Best Practices Guide for SAP BTP

Found a mistake in our documentation? Always wanted to add a step in one of our procedures that could save many others much time? Then you're at the right place! All contributions made to the Markdown files in the [docs](docs) directory are reviewed, and if deemed valuable be added to our [official documentation on SAP Help Portal](https://help.sap.com/viewer/df50977d8bfa4c9a8a063ddb37113c43/Cloud/en-US/9f2bb927464e4d1ba3d13b2d79ca9bd1.html). The easiest way is to start there, and choose _Edit_ to find the right Markdown file to contribute to.

## Requirements

For contributions, it's required that you have a GitHub account. For more information, see [Signing up for a new GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account) in the GitHub documentation.


## Contributing

We recommend using the _Best Practices Guide_ on SAP Help Portal as a starting point for contributions:

1. Open the [Best Practices Guide](https://help.sap.com/viewer/df50977d8bfa4c9a8a063ddb37113c43/Cloud/en-US/9f2bb927464e4d1ba3d13b2d79ca9bd1.html).
1. You can either:
    * Choose *Edit* to suggest a change for the current page you see in the Help Portal viewer, or
    * Choose *Feedback* to open a GitHub issue in this repository.

If you only make a small contribution, that's the quickest way to propose a change. For larger contributions, we recommend forking this repository to work locally. The filenames in the [docs](docs) directory are created based on the title of the page on SAP Help Portal.
